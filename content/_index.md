### How to use this application

How to use this sheet: Each tab will have a group of topics that have shown themselves as painpoints for learners. A pain point is any topic that we have noted that learners struggle to understand in practice, missunderstand, or misapply.   

Each topic tab will have subject, resources for learners, Questions you can ask to affirm understanding, and even a teaching video demos if you are looking for inspiration as a teacher.

### Rules of a Living Document

Rules of a Living Document: If you are given access to this sheet then you have the ability to improve its contents. Know of an awesome resource that is not included?  Add it in.  

Noticed an error in one of the teaching videos? Make a suggestion for an edit or film an amendment.  Found another pain point?  Add it to the list. 

### Beginners Guide  

This doc is intended to help learners who have 0 prior programming expereicne. While there are opportunities for deeper understanding the content of each check point is to enable someone to take away what basics they need to know inorder to not fall behind going through our LC101 Web Dev. curriculum.   It is advised to stay focused on the basics and offer resources for more pro-level or deeper explorations on the sheet. 

### When to use  

When a TA or CEM will choose to use this resource is to their discretion but on each tab there will be a suggested know by time listed. IE. A student should know about How data stores by class 3 etc. 

### Learning is a process  

LaunchCode was founded on the idea of Mastery based learning. Some of the tenants of this philosophy is to 1. Meet the learner where they are. Listen to what they think they know and start from there  2. Let them lead: Mastery comes when a student can teach you about the topic.  3. Metaphors help with symbolicly minded learners. Tell stories, Relate it to common life senarios like how vending machines are like function return values.
